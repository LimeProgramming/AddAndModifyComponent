# Resonite Add and Modify Component

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/).

## What is this?
This is made for my [CreatorJam](https://www.creatorjam.org/) MMC entry. This is intended to be a demo mod to show how easy it can be to add and modify components in code. 
I always suspected that doing that is very easy with actual code but I didn't release how easy it was until I saw the [HeadlessUserCulling](https://github.com/Raidriar796/HeadlessUserCulling) mod. I wanted to share how easy it can be to hopefully spread the message and help someone out. Check out the HeadlessUserCulling mod for a more functional example. 

## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
2. Place [AddAndModifyComponent.dll](https://github.com/LimeProgramming/AddAndModifyComponent/releases/latest/download/AddAndModifyComponent.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create this folder for you.
3. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Resonite logs.
